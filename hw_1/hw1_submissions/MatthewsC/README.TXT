PROJECT TITLE:Homework1

For this project I went to CSL and spoke to the tutors about buliding methods
and how to implement the isAVowel method in part 1. 
I also talked to professor McCauley about how to take the numeric value of a 
sting and how to loop backwards to add up the digits. We also talked about using
the mod operator to carry over the sum of two digits.
