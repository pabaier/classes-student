Kyle gave me a hint on methods for program part one and also told me to go on to zybooks to look back on what we have learned.
Also we had a small group that consisted of Connor, Stefan, Kyle and me to pitch some ideas on certains ways on doing part 1
In addition, I did some research in java API to help me figure out a method on how to make a string into an int for part two of HW1.
