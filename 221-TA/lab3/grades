				There are a few issues with updating the rating. Maybe the biggest thing is that you set the rating to userInput (line 45), which changes the rating to a character value. Another issue you would have if you used nextUserInput is that because you are storing the new value in the same variable that is in the if statement (line 43), if the new rating is the same as a jersey number in your list, then that will trigger the program to wait for another user input. It is better to either ask for user input once outside of the loop and/or use different variables for different user inputs.

	Notes:
		Getting compiling errors: One issue on line 35 is in your for loop "i" is not defined - need "int i". On line 36 and 48, testing equality requires double equals sign ==. Line 40 uses the variable "userRating" which is defined in line 38 inside a different if statement. If a variable is define within an if statement, you cannot use it outside of that if statement.

				Your "isInArray" method is a great idea but does not check the last value in the array (the loop ends too early). You also check if the jersey is in the array twice, once in your method, and once on line 83. You do not need the check on line 83 because at that point you should already know that the jersey number is in the array.
