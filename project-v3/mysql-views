CREATE VIEW WeightChange AS

// get first week
SELECT (Participantsid, Weight) as w1
FROM WeeklyResults
WHERE WeekNumber = 1

// get latest week for each participant
SELECT (Participantsid, Max(WeekNumber) as maxWeek) as wMax
FROM WeeklyResults

// get latest week's weight
SELECT Participantid, Weight as latest
FROM WeeklyResults
INNER JOIN wMax on latest.Participantid = wMax.Participantid

// get week1 weight and latest weight
SELECT lastest.Participantid, w1.Weight, latest.Weight
FROM latest
INNER JOIN w1 on latest.Participantid = w1.Participantid

//THE IDEA IS
Generates list of each participant's total weight change.
Needs to: Get each participant's first week weight (where week  = 1)
                Get each participant's most recent week
                Get each participant's most recent weight (based on most recent week)
                Join the first week weight and most recent week's weight
                Get the difference between the weeks
